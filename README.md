# Kickstarter projects
This is an Interactive Frontend Development project. It is featuring a data dashboard with statistics of Kickstarter projects from 2017.
Presented are such things as categories of projects, most popular countries and currencies,
goal vs. pledged amount of money, state of the projects and number of backers. <br>
This website was made as a project for Code Institute.<br>

# UX
This dashboard was made mostly for people thinking about presenting a project on Kickstarter or already have an existing one.<br>
It's an intro to Kickstarter showing data of submitted projects in 2017.<br>
These user stories were made durring planning stage 
and were used in creating different features for the website:

<ul>
<li>As a Kickstarter client, I want to know the most popular categories of projects to see what people are interested in.</li>
<li>As a person with a project idea, I want to know what percent of all submitted projects are successful to know my success rate.</li>
<li>As a person with a project idea, I want to see the most popular countries submitting projects, to know if my country is one of them.</li>
<li>As a person with a project idea, I want to know the correlation between made goals and pledged amount to see how creating bigger goals are going to affect pledges.</li>
</ul>

Also, in the planning stage, I created <a href='wireframes/wireframes.pdf'>these</a> wireframes. 
Although, the design and some features changed over the development process.
